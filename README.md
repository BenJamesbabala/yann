yann:
version 0.01.01 

Welcome to the Yann Toolbox. It is a toolbox for doing convolutional neural networks, built on top 
of `theano`_. Documentation is temporarily and privately hosted at [my homepage](http://www.public.asu.edu/~rvenka10/_yann/). 
 
.. _theano: http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/ 

.. warning ::

    Yann is currently under its early phases and is presently undergoing massive development. 
    Expect a lot of changes.

.. warning ::
    
      As of now, there are no unit-tests, no Pypi installers and no releases. The toolbox will be 
      formalized in the future but at this moment, the authorship, coverage and maintanence of the 
      toolbox is under extremely limited manpower.

.. note ::
    
    While, there are more formal and wholesome toolboxes that are similar and have a much larger 
    userbase such as `Lasagne`_, `Keras`_, `Blocks`_ and `Caffe`_, this toolbox is much more
    simple and versatile. Yann is a supplement to an upcoming book on Convolutional Neural 
    Networks. It is also good choice for a toolbox for running pre-trained models and build 
    complicated, non-vannilla architecture that are not easy to build with the other toolboxes.

## Who is this code most useful for ?

I wrote this code essentially for my labmates, those who are interested in 
starting deep CNNs to make a fast transition into theano. This will also be 
useful for industry when teting out prototypes.


This page has some rudimentary details on how to run the code and how to use it. I 
am working on a thorough Sphinx Documentation, but until then, thats all I have. 
Contact me if you had trouble.

Thanks for using the code, hope you had fun.
