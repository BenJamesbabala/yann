yann:
version 0.0.1a1 
 
* An even easier, simpler and versatile CNN tool alternative to 
    [Lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne) and [Keras](https://keras.io/).
* Promotes easy learnability and practice of CNNs using theano.
* Modular and plug and play modules and layers.

## Who is this code most useful for ?

I wrote this code essentially for my labmates, those who are interested in 
starting deep CNNs to make a fast transition into theano. It was called samosa then.
Now yann has evolved into a toolbox for CNNs. It is designed as a supplement to an upcoming book on 
Convolutional Neural Networks and also the toolbox of choice for a deep learning course. 

Because of this reason, Yann is specifically designed to be intuitive and easy to use for beginners.
That does not compromise Yann of any of its features. It is still a good choice for a toolbox for 
running pre-trained models and build complicated, non-vannilla CNN architectures that are not easy 
to build with the other toolboxes.This will also be useful for industry when teting out prototypes.

There is a [documentation](http://yann.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
page that has some details on how to run the code and how to use it. I 
am working on a more complete Sphinx Documentation but until then, 
this is all I have. Contact me if you had trouble.

For a quick start into the toolbox, you can use this 
[guide](http://yann.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#quick-start).

Thanks for using the code, hope you had fun.
