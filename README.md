## Who is this code most useful for ?

I wrote this code essentially for my labmates, those who are interested in starting deep learning to make a fast transition into theano. I reckon that this will be most useful for someone who is starting out to be a grad student getting to start research into deep learning (like me) or to someone who wants to do a try out on some kaggle challenge. Parts of the code are directly lifted from [theano tutorials](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/) or from [Misha Denil's repository](https://github.com/mdenil). 

This might not be really useful for advanced deep learning researchers. It's quite basic. If you are a serious researcher and you either find a bug or you want to just make suggestions please feel free, I will be grateful.  

I would recommend my code for quick testing of architecture or ideas in industry also for it is much easier to change the architecture or learning techniques and just simply run a proof of concept. I would also recommend my code as a research tool for someone who wants to quickly jump into deep learning without reading a lot of theory. I havenâ€™t tested the industrial viability of my code yet and although it is fairly fast and is easily portable because it is written in python-theano entirely.

Check the wiki for more details.

Thanks for using the code, hope you had fun.
