yann:
version 0.01.01 
 
* An even easier, simpler and versatile CNN alternative to [Lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne).
* Promotes easy learnability and practice of theano.
* Modelling by just entries in the boilerplate.


## Who is this code most useful for ?

I wrote this code essentially for my labmates, those who are interested in 
starting deep CNNs to make a fast transition into theano. This will also be 
useful for industry when teting out prototypes.

There is a [documentation](http://www.public.asu.edu/~rvenka10/_yann/)
page that has some rudimentary details on how to run the code and how to use it. I 
am working on a complete Sphinx Documentation to go on read the docs, but until then, 
this is all I have. Contact me if you had trouble.

Thanks for using the code, hope you had fun.
