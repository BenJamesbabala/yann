The [wiki](https://github.com/ragavvenkatesan/Convolutional-Neural-Networks/wiki) page has some rudimentary details on how to run the code and how to use it. I am working on a Sphinx Documentation, but until then, thats all I have. Contact me if you had trouble.

Parts of the code are directly lifted from [theano tutorials](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/) or from [Misha Denil's repository](https://github.com/mdenil).

Thanks for using the code, hope you had fun.
