yann:
version 0.01.01 

Welcome to the Yann Toolbox. It is a toolbox for doing convolutional neural networks, built on top 
of [theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/). Documentation is temporarily and privately 
hosted at [my homepage](http://www.public.asu.edu/~rvenka10/_yann/). 
 
    Yann is currently under its early phases and is presently undergoing massive development. 
    Expect a lot of changes. As of now, there are no unit-tests, no Pypi installers and no releases. 
    The toolbox will be formalized in the future but at this moment, the authorship, coverage and 
    maintanence of the toolbox is under extremely limited manpower.


## Who is this code most useful for ?

I wrote this code essentially for my labmates, those who are interested in 
starting deep CNNs to make a fast transition into theano. This will also be 
useful for industry when teting out prototypes.

The [documentation]((http://www.public.asu.edu/~rvenka10/_yann/)) has some rudimentary 
details on how to run the code and how to use it. I am working on a thorough Sphinx 
Documentation, but until then, thats all I have. 

Post in the newly created [yann users group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/yann-users) 
if you had trouble. Thanks for using the code, hope you had fun.
