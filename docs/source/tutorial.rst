Tutorials

If you are here for the first time you might want to consider doing the :ref:`quick_start` instead 
of doing the tutorials. The tutorials are meant for those who have some practice or experience with
the toolbox.

If you'd just want to see the codes or run the examples for testing or other such purposes you 
could follow this tutorial/API. I recommend going through the tutorial though.

    Do tutorials for the following:
        * Check why GPU is not running at 100%
        * LeNet
        * AlexNet
        * Loading pre-trained VGG-19 net
