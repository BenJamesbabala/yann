    This class is the typical neural hidden layer and batch normalization layer. It is called 
    by the ``add_layer`` method in network class.

               are in the following shape ``mini_batch_size, height, width, channels``
        verbose: similar to the rest of the toolbox.

        batch_norm: If provided will be used, default is ``False``.

        activation: String, takes options that are listed in :mod:`activations` Needed for
                    layers that use activations.
                    Some activations also take support parameters, for instance ``maxout``
                    takes maxout type and size, ``softmax`` takes an option temperature.
                    Refer to the module :mod:`activations` to know more.
        input_params: Supply params or initializations from a pre-trained system.

    Notes:
        Use ``dot_product_layer.output`` and ``dot_product_layer.output_shape`` from this class.
        ``L1`` and ``L2`` are also public and can also can be used for regularization.
        The class also has in public ``w``, ``b`` and ``alpha``
        which are also a list in ``params``, another property of this class.
