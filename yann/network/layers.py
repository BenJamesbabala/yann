    This class is the typical 2D convolutional pooling and batch normalizationlayer. It is called 
    by the ``add_layer`` method in network class.

    Args:
        input: An input ``theano.tensor`` variable. Even ``theano.shared`` will work as long as they
               are in the following shape ``batch_size, height, width, channels``
        verbose: similar to the rest of the toolbox.
        nkerns: number of neurons in the layer
        input_shape: ``(batch_size, channels, height, width)``
        filter_shape: (<int>,<int>)
        pool_size: Subsample size, default is ``(1,1)``.
        pool_type: Refer to :mod:`pool` for details. {'max', 'sum', 'mean', 'max_same_size'}
        batch_norm: If provided will be used, default is ``False``. 
        border_mode: Refer to ``border_mode`` variable in ``yann.core.conv``, module 
                        :mod:`conv`              
        stride: tuple ``(int , int)``. Used as convolution stride. Default ``(1,1)``
        rng: typically ``numpy.random``.
        borrow: ``theano`` borrow, typicall ``True``.                                        
        activation: String, takes options that are listed in :mod:`activations` Needed for
                    layers that use activations.
                    Some activations also take support parameters, for instance ``maxout``
                    takes maxout type and size, ``softmax`` takes an option temperature.
                    Refer to the module :mod:`activations` to know more.
        input_params: Supply params or initializations from a pre-trained system.

    Notes:
        Use ``conv_pool_layer_2d.output`` and ``conv_pool_layer_2d.output_shape`` from this class.
        ``L1`` and ``L2`` are also public and can also can be used for regularization.
        The class also has in public ``w``, ``b`` and ``alpha``
        which are also a list in ``params``, another property of this class.
